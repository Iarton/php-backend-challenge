# PHP Challenge

This is what i did in one day. My main mission was to only use PHP Core,
unless I need a package to improve security(DotEnv) or usability without sacrificing perfomance(Guzzle).

## What is Missing

- Add controllers to use the service by request instead of only a command;
- Custom types;
