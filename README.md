# PHP Challenge

My main mission was to only use PHP Core,
unless I need a package to improve security(DotEnv) or usability without sacrificing perfomance(Guzzle).
This was way more fun than expected

## What is Missing

- Add controllers to use the service by request instead of only a command;
- Custom types;
- Errors Throws and treatments;
- A better way to not pass the 60 seconds/request limit on GraphQl than using sleep
